Input data used to calculate mass balance at Lemon Creek Glacier is contained within the USGS Benchmark Glacier Mass Balance and Project Data collection, available at https://doi.org/10.5066/F7BG2N8R. Lemon Creek Glacier is a USGS Benchmark Glacier, and geographically a part of the Juneau Icefield. Data is not duplicated here in order to avoid any potential mismatches or versioning issues. The form of the data and processes used to create it is identical to that described herein.

Output glacier mass balance is given here separately, and differs in a single regard - a lapse rate of 5.0 C/km was used instead of 6.5 C/ km in order to apply long-term weather data from the Juneau Airport to the glacier. Calculation of this location-speciic lapse rate, using shorter-interval temperature data, is described in McNeil et. al 2019: Surface Mass Balance Reanalysis of Taku and Lemon Creek Glaciers, Alaska: 1946-2018. It is possible to calculate this location-specific lapse rate for the Juneau Icefield due to the many long-term (>20 year) temperature records available at camps on the icefield. Differences resulting from use of this lapse rate are generally small, but do create small changes in calculated output values.
