# Ice-lens-and-aquifer-modelling
Modelling the formation of ice lenses and firn aquifers

The code for this project is iterated from / based on:

> Meyer CR and Hewitt IJ (2017) A continuum model for meltwater flow through compacting snow. The Cryosphere 11(6), 2799â€“2813. [doi:10.5194/tc-11-2799-2017](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/11/2799/2017/).

| This project explores ice lens and firn aquifer formation. This work was initially inspired by a potential firn aquifer discvoered on the Juneau Icefield in 2018, in collaboration with the [Juneau Icefield Research Program]https://juneauicefield.org/). | <img src="https://github.com/Elizabethcase/Ice-lens-and-aquifer-modelling/blob/main/project-notes/imgs/JIRP.png" alt="map of survey on the Juneau Icefield showing the aquifer in the northwest corner" width="10%" height="10%" |
|----|----|

It has since expanded more broadly into questions about coincident ice lens-firn aquifer formation.

## Current working questions

1. What aquifer structures/configurations do existing data and observations support?
2. Can the Meyer/Hewitt Model produce an ice lens?
3. Can the model produce ice lenses & firn aquifers in the same column, or would a 2D model be required fro this?
4. Can the Meyer/Hewitt Model produce a stacked firn aquifer?
5. What environmental variables lead to ice lenses & firn aquifers?
6. How stable are these features?

## Project Notes

Notes can be found at [project-notes/ProjectNotes.md](https://github.com/Elizabethcase/Ice-lens-and-aquifer-modelling/blob/main/project-notes/ProjectNotes.md) as an attempt to work somewhat publicly on this project and track my own progress. A caveat -- they are likely: incomplete, maybe wrong, and readily revised. As these are taken from my own notes, there will likely be internal links (to other ntoes) that are broken. Feel free to ping me with any questions!
